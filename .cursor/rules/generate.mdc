[task 1]
i want all camera angles to be shown everywhere, but when driving it should just show these views
- chase
- top
- bottom
- T cam
- front wing
- helper

[task 2]
also add one more camera angle that is side wide so it will be from side angle chasing

[task 3]
while creating path it has y axis missing, which is there while drive to create so wherever i shift+click to add path it should auto align with the road or we can say GLB

[task 4]
currently data is being stored in localstorage, so all paths should be stored in localstorage and also when i use drive to create that should also be stored in localstorage

[task 5]
lets add realism in this map like shadows and all, ofcourse we will need to add few lights and all so give me control for that as well along with copy option so that i can copy and add it in config

[task 6]
make proper config for every part of code which can be changed from config.js, and i mean everything should be able to manage from that file

[task 7]
please make code modular, create proper files like utils, controls, etc which makes code modular and also functional wise as well

[task 8]
lets also write test cases for each and every function using which we can test everything make this testing thing seperately in a folder
