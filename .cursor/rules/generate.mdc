You are an expert in Three.js, JavaScript ES6, and front-end optimization.
I have three pages in my racing simulation project:

Simulation Page: index.html

Drive-to-Create Page: simulation.html

Manual Path Page: path.html

I want you to implement a complete camera and control system with the following rules:

1. Camera Angles per Page & Defaults
(A) Simulation Page â€“ index.html

Available Cameras:

Chase Camera â€“ default

Top Camera

Bottom Camera

T_Cam

Front_Wing

Helper

(B) Drive-to-Create Page â€“ simulation.html

Available Cameras:

Chase Camera â€“ default

Top Camera

Helper

(C) Manual Path Page â€“ path.html

Available Cameras:

Top Camera â€“ default

Helper

2. Keyboard Shortcuts
Camera Switching Keys

Use number keys for switching cameras.

1 â†’ First camera in the list for that page

2 â†’ Second camera in the list for that page

3 â†’ Third camera in the list (if available)

4, 5, 6 â†’ Continue as per list for index.html only

Car Switching (Only for index.html)

C (uppercase or lowercase) â†’ Cycle through available cars to watch

When switching cars, keep the same selected camera angle unless changed manually

Helper Controls

H â†’ Toggle helper camera ON/OFF (if available on that page)

3. Local Storage Behavior

Store the last selected camera angle for each page in localStorage.

Store the last selected car for index.html in localStorage.

On page load, read from localStorage and automatically set the camera and car to the saved values.

Example storage keys:

camera_index.html

camera_simulation.html

camera_path.html

selected_car_index.html

4. Technical Implementation Details

Use Three.js PerspectiveCamera for chase, top, bottom, t_cam, front_wing views.

Use OrthographicCamera only if explicitly needed (like top-down view).

Manage cameras using a CameraManager class:

Holds all camera objects for the current page

Handles switching logic and keyboard binding

Handles localStorage read/write

Optional: Displays current camera name in a small HUD overlay when switching

Use modular ES6 imports so that camera management is reusable between pages.

Each page should only initialize the cameras relevant to it.

Car-following cameras (like chase, front_wing) should attach to the selected carâ€™s object in the scene.

Helper camera can be a free-fly debug camera with OrbitControls.

5. Expected Output

Updated index.html, simulation.html, and path.html scripts with correct camera initialization, switching logic, and car selection (for index).

A shared file cameraManager.js that:

Initializes cameras based on page config

Handles keyboard shortcuts

Saves/loads from localStorage

Code should be fully commented, clean, and optimized for performance.
